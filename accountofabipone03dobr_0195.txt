A COMPANY OF HOSTILE ABIPONES, AND, ΟΝ ANOTHER
OCCASION, FIGHTS SUCCESSFULLY WITH OAHERKAIKIN.

THE CharruaS, a fieree equestrian nation‚ after
being long formidable to travellers on the eastern
bank of the Parana, were at length made cap-
tive, sor the most part, by a troop of horse from
Sta. Fe, and assembled in a colony founded in
the plain Cajasta, where they were instructed
in the divine law by a priest of the order of
St. Francis. These savages, formerly so sloth-
sul, were impelled by hunger to make great
exertions in cultivating land. But the plains
adjacent to the town, being in great part
marshy‚ scarce afforded a⁴ place where seed
could be sown with any prospect of a har-
vest, and the hill occupied by the colony
seemed too small for the number of inhabitants,
On which account, some Charruas were sent by
the priest to explore the remoter plainS, and
endeavour to find a better situation for the
colony. On their return, they communicated
their discovery of a very numerous horde of

Abipones near La Laguna Blanca. The Vice«
