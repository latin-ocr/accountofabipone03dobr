HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 81

qualified to pursue the savages, from their ina-
bility to swim3 the cause of this deficiency is
that most of them live in a place where swimÎ‡
ming is not customary, or where there is no
opportunity for practising it. There is a place,
between Cordoba id St. Iago, called Rio SeCO.
Scattered here and there in little vallies between
the hills are great numbers of well-peopled
estates, and cattle of every description. ln
this place is a large, elegant stone church, which
owes its celebrity to an image of the Virgin
Mary, and Whither numbers flock from all parts,
as it has been distinguished by the favour of
Heaven and the gifts of the pious. The Abi-
pones had informed themselves of this circum-
stance from their Spanish captives. The opu-
lence of the place afforded them great hopes of
a rich booty. Having diligently examined
every thing through their spies, they resolved
to occupy the narrow straits of the rocks, aud
block up all the ways, to deprive the Spaniards
of the means of flight. They either slew, or
made captive, all they sound in the neighbouring
fields, and in the houses, without opposition:
the whole country was devastated. An immense
number of horses and mules were taken by the
savages. The church itself was forced, while
affording shelter to those who survived the
massacre, and had fied thither sor refuge.
