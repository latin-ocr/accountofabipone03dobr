320 HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES.

Spaniards? The country itself, as I declared
at first sight, was unfavourable to plants, be-
cause it abounded in chalk. After much rain,
it bore the appearance of a lake—when the
waters subsided it became as hard and dry as a
stone. N otwithstanding this, the Abipones did
plough and sow great part of it, but they lost
their labour; in the woods‚ however, where
the soil is more fertile, and the sun's heat kept
off by the shade of the trees, they reaped an
abundant and easily-earned harvest of various
fruits. I found the soil extremely favourable to
the tobacco which I planted, but could never
find a situation fit for sowing cotton. The alfa-
roba was only to be found in distant forests, but
the want of it was supplied by abundance of
honey. Other fruits, which grow quite com-
mon elsewhere, are extremely scarce here. The
country near the shore abounds in stags, deer,
and emus, the neighbouring rivers in crocodiles,
water-wolves, and capibariS, but are mostly
destitute of fish. It is a remarkable circum-
stance, that the river near the colony swarmed,
for some days, with every kind of fish, which
were easily caught with the hand, as they swiftly
hurried down the stream ; they are thought to
have been conveyed into this river by interme-
diate pools, from the Rio Grande, at the time of
the annual flood.
