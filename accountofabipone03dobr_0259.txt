HISTORY oF THE ABlPONES. 247

That I might not, therefore, remain alone and on
foot in this vast desert, in case my companions
should fly and leave me, I ordered the swiftest
of my horses to be caught and harnessed, that I
might accompany the rest as far as possible.
Fatigued and drowsy‚ I slept greatest part of the
night on the bare turf at my horse’s feet, holding
the reins and a musket in my hand.

As soon as morning dawned, whilst the sand
on the shores of the river bore visible marks of
the feet of the Indians, the soldiers, disregard-
ing the commands of their captain, returned
home full speed, and obliged me to follow them,
unless I preferred perishing in a perilous wilcl,
full a hundred leagues in extent. I had ninety-
four leagues to return, for to such a distance
from the city had we travelled. The soldiers,
to shorten the way, passed through the trackless
woods of Turugbn, and through marshy fields, till
>they arrived, with me, at their native place, Sa-
labina. The priest of the village, Clement Xerez
de Calderon, embraced me with the utmost cor-
diality, and'consoled me when I complained of
the return of the runaway soldiers. “ You >are
, come to this town,” said he, “ by divine dispen-
sation, to pronounce a panegyric on the Holy
Mother :” for the Carmelite feast was at hand,
which is annually celebrated in that place for

nine successive days. Numbers of all ranks
