close impendi-ng woods3 air burning day and
night; and a very small apartment furnished
with two doors but no window, and roofed with
the bark of the palm, so badly cemented, that,
whenever it rained, you were as much wetted
in the house as if you had been out of doorS.
At dinner, water was taken from a neighbouring
ditch-where numbers of horseS, dogs, and other
animals daily drank and bathed, which received
all the filth of the town, and was full of leeches
and insects of different kinds, When I consi-
dered these things I no longer wondered that the
health of my predecessors had given way, and
that the Indians themselves had so often to
contend with tertian severs.

, Although I had remained uninj ured amidst a
hundred calamities during the former years, yet
this situation had well nigh proved fatal to me.
The origin of my complaint was this. Towards
sun-set the air was filled with innumerable
gnats, which intruded into my apartment when
supper was brought in, and by their stings and
their loud hissing prevented me from gaining a
moment’s rest. I passed whole nights without
sleep‚ walking up and down the court-yard for
the sake of fresh air, which brought on a loath-
ing of food. Continual want of rest and sus-
tenance reduced me to such an emaciated state
that I was literally nothing but skln and bone.
