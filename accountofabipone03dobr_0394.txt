382 msronv or THE ABIPONES.

Though of mean extraction, he was famous for
military deeds3 politic, intrepid, courteous to
his own countrymen, and formidable to stran-
gers3 qualities which gained him the title of
Cacique, and the celebrated names, first of
Revachigi, afterwards of Oahari. Though
scarcely more than thirty years of age, he had
rendered his name already illustrious, being
superior to most of the Abipones in dignity and
beauty of person, in dexterity in horsemanship
and the handling of weapons, in contempt of

 

danger, and in greatness of mind. He was ,

always well-disposed towards me, and attentive
to my admonitions, except that, from too great a
desire to gratify his countrymen, he suffered
himself to be hurried into viceS, which they
indeed account virtueS, and was restrained
from laying any commands or prohibitions on
his people by the consideration that the title of
Cacique did not belong to him by hereditary
right, but had been conferi-ed by the free votes
of the people, and consequently was a very
precarious honour. ln one respect, he was
more fortunate than the Caciques Debayakaikin,
Ychamenraikin, and Alaykin, who, though old
inhabitants of our colonies, died in battle with·
out having received baptism; whereas he, of his
own accord, desired to undergo the ceremony,
when he found himself at the point of death.
