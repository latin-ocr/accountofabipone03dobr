ffls'ronY OF THE ABIPoNEs. 419

poneS, though it did not equa] our wishes, ex-
ceeded the expectations of the Spaniards. I
have given this aceount of the Abipones with
the greatest fidelity possible, though not in the
most elegant style. Veracity was more my
aim than polished language. The judicious
reader will pardon any rusticity of expression
in an author who has passed so many years
amongst savages in the Woods of America.

THE END.
