their clothes and of their arms, could with diffi-
culty pursue the fugitives, especially if marsheS,
rivers, and trackless woods intervened. Em-
boldened by these considerations, they left
nothing unattempted against Tucuman. Salta,
the residence of the Governour, and other
places surrounding it, were exposed to the
daily assaults of the savages.

Estevan Urizar, when he came from Spain
to govern the province, endeavoured to devise
a remedy sor the public calamity. He pro-
posed an expedition against Chaco3 Seventeen
hundred and eighty countrymen were chosen
to attend it out of all Tucuman, beside five
hundred Indian ChristianS, who were increased
by a troop of Chiriguanos, at that time allies.
Add to these, five hundred from the city of
Asumpcion, three hundred from Sta. Fe, and
two hundred from CorrienteS. ln short, such
an army was raised that the savages were sur-
rounded on all sides. The Tucuman soldiers
were ordered to explore the retreats of the
savageS, and put them to deathÍ¾ the other
Spaniards, who dwelt nearer the south, to pre-
vent their escape by blocking up the roads:
and if as much diligence had been employed in
the execution of the project as good policy in
the planning of it, the whole swarm of savages
in Chaco would have been entirely subdued.
