H-ISTORY or THE ABIPONES. 291

our people were lying in ambuscade‚ avoided
that situation, and swifty fied with their booty
through ways impeded with marshes ancl reeds,
first disencumbering themselves of the saddles,
and whatever else might retard their flight3
which, as it could be made no use of, our
people burnt. For my own part I had to
lament the loss of some excellent horseS‚ though
consoled by the circumstance that this aggres-
sion had ended without slaughter on either side,
though there is reason to doubt that all the
Mocobios reached home without loss of blood,
as weapons were cast at them in their ap-
proach to the estate by some Yaaukanigasr who
guarded the cattle, but with what success is
not known.
