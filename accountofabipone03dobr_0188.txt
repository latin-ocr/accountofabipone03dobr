a hair’s breadth from the line of battle. The
victors cut off the heads of those most renowned
for valour, and carried them home as trophies.
Two, who sell amongst the dead bodies and,
being thought useless, had, the one an ear, the
other a finger cut off by a Mocobio, appeared a
a few months after alive, in the town of St.
Ferdinand.

All the men being slain, the Mocobios‚ irri-
tated by the death of their Cacique, took delight
in venting their fury on the women, who had
taken refuge in a neighbouring wood. Forty
women and children were slain‚ and many taken
captive; which cruelty, as it was exercised
towards the defenceless, we all condemned
in the strongest manner. Many of our Abi-
pones and Mocobios' were wounded‚ but none
slain except Ychamenraikin. The bones of this
Cacique, after being stripped of the flesh,
received the last obsequies‚ accompanied by
the tears of the whole town, and by funeral
rites, as has been related elsewhere.
