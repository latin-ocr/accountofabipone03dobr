HISTonY OF THE ABIPONES. 275

fested all the ways between Cordoba and Sta.
Fe with a great company of Abipones, and be-
came highly formidable to all travellerS. Of the
Spanish merchants some were slain, some robbed,
and others annoyed by vexatious detention.

I informed Barreda‚ by means of a trusty
messenger, of the slaughter and. rapine com-
mitted by the hostile Abipones, and of their
threats and intentionS, that he might, if pos-
sible, find some means of restraining their bold-
neSS, and providing for the security of the Spa-
nish travellers. Troops of horse had indeed
been repeatedly sent uS, both to act as guards
and to build our houses: yet the savages never
made closer or more daring attacks upon our
colony, never carried off greater numbers of
horses and oxen, or caused us more trouble and
danger than when these few soldiers were pre-
sent. At length Barreda came· himself with
two companies of horse, and directed a couple
of small rooms to be built for us of unbaked
brick, and wooden beams3 a third, of the same
materials, but longer, was styled a chapel. Wc
ourselves were not mere spectators‚ but stre-
nuous assistants in the whole work :-—labori0usly
occupied with mud and timber, we wearied
both our hands and feet for whole days,

It grieved us greatly that buildings erected

with so 'much labour should be occupied by us
