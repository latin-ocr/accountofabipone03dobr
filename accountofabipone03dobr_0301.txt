HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 289

considerable distance, no one therefore thought
of pursuing them, I often blew a military
trumpet, and With a loud voice we uttered many
pleasant sayings in the Mocobian tongue3 we
were both seen and heard by the MocobiOS,
who were lurking hard by, but not attacked,
because they purposed making an assault on
the town next day. No suspicion of the enemy’s
intention being entertained, we all slept soundly.
But lo! and behold, the next day at eleven
o'clock the same Mocobios came in sight of the
town to carry off the remaining herd of horses.
Most of the Yaaukanigas being engaged in the
chase, the rest in drinking, and we ourselves in
sleeping, as usual with the Spaniards at mid-
day, the women assembled together and filled
' the market-place and our court—yard with their
lamentations3 awakened by which we flew to
repel the enemy, each furnished with a musket,
and rendered, by this means, formidable to ever
so numerous a foe. Father Klein set off first,
accompanied by two Abipones. As I was fol-
lowing, a drunken Yaaukaniga took me by the
shoulder, and said, in a fierce tone, “ Where
are you hurrying? Why don't you remain to
guard the town? It is better that our horses
should be taken than our wives and children.''
“ Let me alone,” replied 13 “both shall be
taken care of.''
