and Mbayas3 on the other the dailyassaults of
the Abipones, MocobiOS, and Tobas occasioned
much danger and fatigue to the surrounding
colonies. Add to these the Payaguas, most
perfidious pirateS, more dangerous in peace
than in war: not to mention the wood-savageS,
the Monteses, Montarrazes, or Caayguas, who,
though not always openly hostile to the Para—
guayrian Spaniards, whilst they prepared the

the city, are full of eumity towards them, and
justly suspected of unsound saith. See! how
many nations threatened the Spanish colonists.
