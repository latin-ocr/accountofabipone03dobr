be recalled by the eloquence of their captain.
The same day we chose a situation to pass the
night in, which the nature of the place defended
from sudden attackS, the river Salado‚ with its
steep bank, being in front, and a rugged wood
behind. But about sun-set, just when the horses
were let loose to pasture, and we ourselves
seated at the fire, our ears were assaulted by
a sudden howling of the savages from the wood,
which, to the cowardly soldierS, was the signal
for flight, not for a battle. Without delay
every one catches his horse, and gets it ready.
I represented to them that if they quitted their
station the Indians might easily slay them
whilst dispersed‚ but that if they remained
united in one company, I saw nothing so very
dreadful to be apprehended, as we had muskets
in readineSS, and the savages would attempt
nothing that night if they smelt gunpowder.
By this speechI prevailed upon them to remain
quietly where they were, but at every motion
the savages made they flew to their horses,
which they had ready saddled3 so great was
their trepidation. One of the soldiers, a fat,
but very handsome man, dissolved into tears,
dolefully exclaiming every minute, “ Then we
must die this night !'' For myself, Ifreely con-
fess that the fears of my com panions caused me
more alarin than the threats of the savages.
