necessary supply of arms and other utensils,
by the booty obtained elsewhere. I learnt
many things of this traffic with the Indians,
some worthy of laughter, but more which
deserve indignation. Take this one instance.
An Abipon entered the city of Sta. Fe, in time
of peace, carrying on his horse a leathern
bag containing two thousand Spanish crowns.
A certain noble Spaniard, who happened to
be walking in the market-place at the time,
doubtless very well acquainted with the con-
tents of the bag, offered him the red cloak
which he wore3 the Indian, transported with
joy, gave him in exchange the whole weight
of silver which he had plundered a little
before from the waggons laden with Peru-
vian money. Great part of the Mocobios
and Tobas, and most of the Abipones, being
persuaded to a peace, and conducted to the
various colonies which we had founded, this
miserable city at last enjoyed a little rest,
although the estates were not entirely free from
danger3 for the savages of these nations, weary
of peace, lay in wait for droves of horses, but
more in the way of plundering than of regular
warfare. To restrain these pillagers, a Spanish
company of horse was maintained at the public
cost, and, headed by Miguel Ziburro, proved
very useful in deterring them from their de-
