HrsTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 241

apprehend treachery and deceit in the sriendship
of the Spaniards. Alaykin‚ though often in-
vited, had uniformly declined going: now, in-
duced by what reasons I do not know, he sud-
denly arrived, whilst I was at St.1ag0, with
two of the more reputable Abipones, and after
resting three days in that city, pursued his
journey to Salta. The provident Barreda sent
two Spaniards with him, one to act as guide,
the other as interpreter, and both as defenders
against assailants. This journey was little ap-
proved either by Barreda or myself 3 because
we foresaw that should any one of the Abi-
pones perish amongst those rocks, either from the
unwonted cold of a foreign clime3 or from ter-
tian ague, which is very common there, on ac·
count of the unwholesome water3 or froin any
other cause; the whole Abiponian nation would
undoubtedly attribute it to the malignant arts of
the SpaniardS, and this suspicion would be the
origin of animmediate war. The first day that the
Abipones spent at St. Iago they were very near
conceiving suspicions injurious to the Spaniards.
At that time the yearly rite was solemnized of
*carrying about the holy waser, some praying
with a loud voice, some singing, and others
dancing, to imitate David when he leapt before
the ark of the covenant. To testify the public
joy, very small muskets were fired up and down
