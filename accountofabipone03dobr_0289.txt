guest proved in reality an enemy to the colony
by frequently involving it in broils, on account

however, he bade farewel to the town of Con-2
cepcion, and retired, with most of his people‚ to
their ancient retreats in Chaco, where, as I have
related, he was slain in battle by Ychoalay6

The colony, freed from the disturbers of its
peace, began at length to enjoy tranquillity3
but the fruits never corresponded to the labour
bestowed upon it for many years by the inde-
fatigable Sanchez and his various companions.
Many adults, however, especially when at the
point of death, and a still greater number of in-
fantS, received baptisni; the rest were civilized.
The Spaniards accounted the friendship of this
nation, formerly for many years their bitterest
enemies, an immortal benefit; and learnt, at
length, after they had lost uS, that to our patience
and industry they were chiefly indebted for it:
for when, to the grief of all Paraguay, we were
sent back to Europe, almost ¹all the Abipones
returned to their former savage state, and were
not to be appeased by the Spaniards without
the utmost difficulty.
