SOME THINGS WORTHY OF NOTE RESPECTING YCIIOALAY
AND OAHERKAIKIN.

OAHERKAIKIN, a Nakaiketergehe, and a
tribesman of Debayakaikin, was of middling
stature, lean, strong-boned, with a pale face, a
stem countenance, small sunken eyeS‚ and
short hair shaven at intervals, like that of a
monk; his limbs were all covered with large
scars3 his ears were bored to admit the knots
of cow's horn which he wore by way of ear-
rings; he seemed always either in the act of
threatening‚ or absorbed in contemplation. He
was a great lover of drinking-partieS, a man of
few words, though very affable to his followers;
an implacable foe to the Spaniards ; ever sor-
midable, even when threatening nothing3 won-
derfully well—skilled in the use of the spear and
other weapons, and in the arts of riding and
swimming3 extremely attached to the super-
stitions of the savages; a despiser of elegant
clothing; and enclowed with an intrepid and
daring mind3 but careless of his promises; given
to falsehood and knavery3 and well worthy of
his name Oaherkaikin‚ which signifies a liar.
