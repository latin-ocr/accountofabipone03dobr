HISTORY oF THE ABIPONES. 381

gerice of this colony: for the money which the
piety of the King had appropriated to the
support of the Missionaries, was the chief, and
almost the only source from which we used to
purchase the sacred utensiIS, the instruments of
iron, and* other necessaries for clothing and
remunerating the Indians.

Worn out by two years' affiictions, labours,
and cares3 frequently tormented by the g0ut3
and deprived of the use of my middle finger3 I
requested the Provincial to substitute another
priest in my place. At length, at the end of
three monthS, J oseph Brigniel, a veterati
Missionary of the Abipones and Guaraniesâ€š
accompanied by Father Jeronymo Rejon, was
appointed my successor. Both ofthem, though
they had come from the city plentifully furnish-
ed with small gifts to gain the good-will of the
inhabitants, and with things pertaining to
domestic use, were daily called upon for the
exertion of their patience, finding the Abipones
little tractable, the Mocobios and Tobas ever
hostile. These latter, not to mention other
instance& invaded the colony whilst Brigniel
was performing divine service3 on which occa-
sion an old Guarany shepherd was killed in the
country, and Oahari, amongst several others,
received a deep wound in battle. This Cacique
died soon after of the deadly bite of a serpent.
