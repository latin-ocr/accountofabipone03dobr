flrsTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 345

expired next day some hours before noon.
The ferocious TobaS‚ when informed of the
baptism and death of their Cacique, accused
me, who had administered the one, of being
the cause of the other, and resolved to avenge
him by armS, as I had openly foretold before
we were made acquainted with the intention
of the Tobas; for I knew that to these stupid
savages baptism appeared more destructive
than small-pox‚ or the most subtle poison.
The affair was not confined to threats alone:
a few days after, the revengeful Tobas drove
away more than five hundred horses from our
pastures, in the dead of the night, and would
doubtless have slain some of our people had
an opportunity offered. Our AbiponeS, com-
plaining of this loss of horses, flew to Asump-
cion, and besought the Governor to allow
some Spanish horse to sally forth with them
for the purpose of chastizing the plunderers3
and their entreaties seemed almost needless,
in requesting what had long been the Gover-
nor's own desire. From what we shall relate
hereafter‚ you will find the small-pox to have

been the occasion of mutual incursions and .

slaughters, and of the shedding of my blood.
