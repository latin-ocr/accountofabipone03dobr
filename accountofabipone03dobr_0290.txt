CHAPTER XXXII.v

A COLONY INHABITED BY THE YAAUKANIGA ABIPONES,
' AND DISTINGUISIIED BY THE NAME OF ST. FERDINAND
AND ST. FRANCIS.

THE city of CorrienteS‚ brought to extremities
by the depredations of the savages, had long
been desimus to follow the example of the other
cities, and found a colony of Yaaukaniga Abi-
pones, which might defend them against the in-
roads of the Tobas and Mocobios. A little town
was at length prepared under the directions of the
Vice-Governor Patron, and with, the consent of
Yohoalay, who at first opposed the design. The
Indians had themselves made choice of a situa-
tion, whieh, though not the most opportune,was
approved by the Spaniards, from their being
unable to meet with a more eligible one. It is a
small pieee of plain ground,two leagues distant ν
from the western shore of the Parana, a little
below its junotion with the Paraguay. Towards
the east it has the city Corrientes in front, and
behind it flows the Rio Negro, the waters of
which are so bitter and salt that the very beasts
refuse them. It is surrounded on every side by
woods and poolS, all destitute os fresh water,
