“msTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 55

CHAPTER VII.

OF THE EXPEDITIONS OF FRANCISCO BARREDA, GENE-
RAL OF THE ST. IAGANS, AGAINST THE ABIPONES

AND MOCOBIOS.

AST1G1, a city ofAndalusia‚ was his native place.
He was born of a most respectable family, and
had been in the King's service from his earliest
years. He set sail from Cadiz for Paraguay,
while yet a youth, bearing letters from the King,
in the office of naval secretary. This voyage
is often performed in three or four monthS, with
a favourable wind3 Barreda and his compa-
nions, miserably tost about the ocean, scarce
reached the port of Buenos-Ayres on the tenth.
Having dispatched their business in that city,
all things were put in readiness sor return-
ing to Europe, and they entered the vessel.
But just as they were going to raise anchor, a
furious south wind encountered the ship‚ turned
it on its beam-ends‚ and would have sunk it,
had it not been held by steady anchors. The
crew remained the whole night on a sand bank,
expecting death every moinent. The shades of
night increased their fears and their danger.
