assailantS, but at last fell oppressed by nurn-
bers. He expired wounded in many placeS‚
having been first dragged out of doors by
strong straps of leather, with which his hands
and feet were bound. Lisondo being slain, the
few who escaped the eyes and hands of the
savageS, saved their lives by ssight. Three or
four leapt on to the same horse, and beginning
their journey without any provisions, the fugi-
tives were threatened with fresh dangers of
death. They had to travel at least fifty leagues,
in a vast solitude, before they could reach the
dwellings of men. Hence, wasted with hunger,
thirst‚ and apprehension‚ they at length reached
home, many of them on foot, and though they
had escaped death, looked more dead than
alive. Meanwhile, in the scene of so much
bloodshed, a vast quantity of wax and honey,
a number of excellent horses and muleS, the
large brazen caldrons for refining the wax, the
axes and various other iron implements, and
the wearing apparel, became the prey of the
savages; whilst the owners at St. Iago bitterly
deplored the deaths of the men, and the loss
of their property. The Abipones who com-
mitted this slaughter were those who, till then,
had refused to enter the colonies founded for
their nati0n3 but they soon after took refuge in
them to avoid the vengeance of the Spaniards.
