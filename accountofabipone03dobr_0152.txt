able. He tries the chance of war. A very
sew Riikakes fought bravely for a little while
with a great number of Nakaiketergehes,
though there was more shouting and trumpet-
ing than bloodshed. The loss amounted to
two men slain, and some wounded on each
side. But Ychoalay narrowly escaped being
killed, and was obliged to fly with his people.
To save his lise, he left his spear on the field of
battle, a disgrace which likewise befel two of
his companions. The Riikahes also left in the
hands of the enemy a number of their horses.
Urged by the instant peril, two or three leapt
upon one horse, some unarmed, others naked,
and fied, with all speed, to the colony of St. Jero-
nymo. This expedition proved the origin of a
twenty years' war between the Riikahes and
Nakaiketergehes. Î™ shall confine myself to a
brief narration of the most important events:
for were I to describe all the successive vicissi-
tudes of this war, I should consume more ink,
than there was blood spilt in the whole course
of it. Let me now give you the portraits of
Ychoalay and Oaherkaikin, the authors of the

war.
