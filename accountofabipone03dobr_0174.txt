change his name, he always retained his primi-
tive one of Ychoalay. So great was his dislike.
of ostentation in apparel and horse-trappings,
that he scorned to keep company with. some
youths, who gave themselves proud airs, and
fed daintily. Conscious of his own merits, he
had, undeniably‚ a very high opinion of himself,-
yet he detested flattery, and never boasted of
any thing but of being no braggadocio. He
could not bear that his rivals Oaherkaikin and
Debayakaikin should be preferred to himself:
yet when informed of any brave action per-
formed by one of his own nation in battle, he
would overflow in his praise. You will learn
many things reflecting honour on the noble
Ychoalay, in my relation of the vicissitudes of
the furious war between the Riikahes and N a-
kaiketergehes.
