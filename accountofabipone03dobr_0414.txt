ear to* the instructions of the priests, when
they daily hear and see words and actions
*so discordant to them in the old ChristianS.
Indians returned from captivity amongst
the Spaniards, Spaniards in captivity amongst
the Indians, stranger from the cities, sol-
diers sent for the defence of the colonies,
and Spanish guards appointed to take care of
the cattle, were all certain plagues of the
Abiponian colonieS. Ι should never make an
end were I to relate all I know on this subject.
That the bad examples of the Christians
greatly retarded the progress of religion
amongst the AbiponeS, cannot be controverted.
Let the old Christians of America become
Christians in their conduct, and the Abipones‚
MocobiOS, Tobas, MataguayOS, Chiriguanos, in
a word, all the Indians of Paraguay will cease

Christ. This subject was treated of in the
pulpit before the Royal Governor, J oseph An-
donaegui, and a noble congregation, by the
Jesuit P. Domingo Muriel, a Spaniard eminent
for sanctity and learning, afterwards master of
theology in the academy at Cordoba, and
author of a most useful work intituled Fasti
IVovi Orbis, printed at Venice in the year 1776.
