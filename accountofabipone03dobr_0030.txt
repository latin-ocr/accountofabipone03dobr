predations. Three places, in particular, were
the resorts of the savages, and the soenes of
their robberieS, La cruz· alta, Ec pozzo redon·
cl0‚ and the estate of St. Thomas; in the one
place there is a passage across the river Salado
to the city, in the other a high way with wag-
gons of traders continually passing to and sro.
The estates also which look towards Chaco
were endangered. The extensive province of
Asumpcion, although it abounds in warlike
colonists, was incredibly harassed by the arms
of the Abipones and Mocobios. Who can
enumerate the men that were slain, the horses
and mules that were seized, the villages that
were burnt, the estates that were depopulated,
and the numbers of unarmed that were led
into captivity? Not only on the banks of the
Paraguay, but also in places far distant from
that river, many and great slaughters were
committed with impunity. This captaincy of
Paraguay is of greater extent than the rest,
yet it seems too small for the number of
colonistS. It contains as many soldiers as
men, but they are scattered up and down the
country, many leagues distant from one an-
other, occupied, greatest part of the year, in
remote forests where they prepare the herb of
Pal-aguay, or on the banks of rivers, or in de-
fending little fortifications of the province.
