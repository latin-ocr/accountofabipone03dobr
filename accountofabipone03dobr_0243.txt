ms'rom( or THE ABIPONES. 231

mies were not able to reach our town, yet a
rumour which spread amongst us respecting
their numbers, and the journey they had com-
menced‚ disturbed our minds almost more than
their actual presence would have done. Esteem-
ing themselves unable to cope with such a
mighty force, numbers withdrew from the co-
lony, under pretext of a desire to hunt3 and the
few who remained, having their apprehensions,
and their actual danger augmented by the num-
ber of seceders, were constantly filling our ears
with reports of the enemy's approach, so that
we were obliged to be perpetually on the watch
to prevent the possibility of a surprize. To
this constant war with foreign foes was added
an intestine one between the two Abiponian
nations, whose inveterate enmities were ex-
tremely detrimental to the progress os the new
colony.

About this time continual tumults were
created in the neighbouring town of St. Jero-
nymo by Debayakaikin‚ who, as Ι have related,
was always either threatening or assaulting.
Ychoalay, believing our Alaykin to be amicably
inclined towards that Cacique, and privy to his
machinations to the hurt of the Riikahes, enter—
tained an implacable hatred towards him on
that account, and left nothing unattempted

which might cause trouble to his hordesmen.
