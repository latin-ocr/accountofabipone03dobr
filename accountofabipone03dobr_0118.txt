Mataras trembled at⁴ the very name of these
savageS, and were half dead with sear at the
idea of being so near them. The eloquence of
the Fathers was scarce sufficient to do away
their fears. To ascertain that all was safe, it
was intrusted to Father Cerqueira to go sor-
ward with two companions, and endeavour to
find out some method of presenting himself ⁴to
the Abipones and entering their hordes, with-
out being suspected of hostile intentions. The
Father had scarcely gone a league when he
met a troop of two hundred AbiponeS‚ who had
been apprized, by their emissaries,¹ of the ar-
rival of foreigners. Approaching them, of his
own accord, he spoke to the savages in the
Tonocote language, which many of the Abi-
pones, at that time, were acquainted with.
“ You are greatly mistaken,” said he, “ if you
imagine that I am alarmed at seeing you, which
is the very thing that I most desire. After
crossing immense wildernesses, and struggling
through an hundred dangers for your sake, Iam
here at last. Do not take me for an enemy,
nor cherish unkindly feelings towards me. Be-
hold I corne unarmed to teach you the way to
happiness. If you have your own welfare at
heart, do not reject the Author of it in me, but
rather look upon me as a friend, and as the

messenger of the great Creator of all things.”
