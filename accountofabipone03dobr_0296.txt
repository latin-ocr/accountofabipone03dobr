284 ffls‘ronv oF THE ABIPONES.

Some thought I could not survive above ethree
months, but these sad presages were prevented
from being fulfilled by the humanity of the Pro-
vincial‚ at whose command I was removed to
the old towns of the Guaranies. It was not with-
out tears that I bade farewell to the Abipones,
amongst whom I had lived for five years, and
with whose language I was become pretty well
acquainted3 but the idea of returning to them,
when restored to health, mitigated my grief at
parting. After four months spent in the town¹
of Sta. Maria Mayor, on the shores of the Uru-
guay, the inveterate nausea departed, sleep and
appetite returned, and my health was· com-
pletely re-established. After spending· nine
years amongst the GuaranieS, whose language,
which is much easier than the Abiponian, Ι soon
learnt, I was again called out to found a colony
sor the Abipones in Timbo, but returned at the
end of two years. In short, I performed the
part of a missionary for eighteen years, spend-
ing seven amongst the Abipones, eleven amongst
the Guaranies.
