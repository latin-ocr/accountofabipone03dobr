HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 53

The Abipones raged with still more violence
and pertinacity against those colonies which
look towards the south, and are near the
territories of Cordoba. Zumampa, Las Bar-
rancas, and El Oratorio, for a long time wit-
nessed the cruelty of the savages. A whole
village was destroyed, while some of the inha-
bitants were slain, and others made captive,
scarce one or two surviving. This country is
intersected by a high road, through which wag-
gons loaden with Peruvian money frequently
pass to Buenos-Ayres. The certainty of booty
and great facility of committing depredations
had attracted the Abipones to these parts of
the province, to the great annoyance of mer-
chants, who were thus necessitated either to
lose their merchandise, or to bring soldiers at
a great expense to defend the waggons and
their drivers, who often lost their lives as they
were endeavouring to defend the lives and pro-
perties of others.

These and many other things of this kind
were committed by the Abipones against the
inhabitants of St. Iagoâ€š who knew not that they
had to deal with a people accustomed to leave no-
thing unrevenged. They frequently eluded the
attempts of the enemy by vigilance, oftener
warded them off by dint of brave exertions.
They often returned slaughter sor slaughter,
