(ἱ msronv or THE ABlPONES.

But of the Spanish soldiers who were'called
from the southern colonies, some delayed,
others deserted, so that towards the south a
way lay open to the Mocobios, who escaped,
without hindrance, on every side, and took
refuge in the hordes of the Abipones. But as
they did not consider this situation at a sus-
ficient distance from the attacks of the Spani-
ards, both people secretly removed into the
vale of Calchacui. On this account Salta and
the upper parts of Tucuman were relieved, for
some yearS, from the attacks of the MocobiOS‚
but all the storm of the war fell on the cities
Sta. Fe, St. Iago del Estero, Corrientes, and
the other Spanish colonies situate to the south-
west. That the Malbalaes‚ deserted by the
Mocobios their greatest supporters, accepted,
or seigned to accept, the friendship of the Spa-
niards3 that the Vilelas and Chunipies agreed
upon a peace3 that the Lules were assembled
in a town at Milaflores, and there instructed
in the holy religion by Father Antonio Machoni,
were the advantages which resulted from this
great expedition: but, though considerable, they
fell sar below the wishes and expectations of
the Spaniards.
