just as I was going to mount my horse3 “ You
have had more to endure in two years, in the
situation you have just quitted, than others go
through during many years in other colonies.''
The rector also desired me to defer my journey
for a while, and to aet instead of the Jesuit
priest, who was absent on business, in the estate
of our college, called Paraguay, and twenty
leagues distant from Asumpeion. This place
stretohes out on one side into a pleasant plain,
affording pasture to a vast quantity of cattle3
on the other, where it looks towards the south,
it is surrounded by hills and rocks3 in one of
which a cross piled up of three large stones
is visited, and held in great veneratior] by
the natives for the sake of St. Thomas3 sor
they believe, and firmly maintain, that the
Apostle, seated on these stones as on a ehair,
formerly preached to the assembled Indians.

my journey on horsebaek, aceoxnpanied by a
few N egroes3 for the shores of the Tebiguary,
which we erossed in a boat, are thought ex-
tremely dangerous for travellerS. On Christ-
