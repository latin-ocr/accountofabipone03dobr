HISTORY OF THE ABIPONES. 169

multuous night, during my whole residence in
America. Iaccused the sun of returning too
slowly. About day-break, when the tempest
was abated, though the lightning had not yet
ceased, I ran to the market-place, where I
saw a number of AbiponeS‚ assembling at the
end of the town, which they considered a fit
place for the ensuing combat. The army was
arranged by Ychamenraikin in such a manner,
that th'e spearmen occupied each side, the
'archers the centre; and all were on soot. A
troop of horse commanded by Ychohake, Ycho-
alay's brother, had it in charge, to learn and
instantly report the motions of the enemy, the
ways they took, and every thing else con-
cerning them. They stood in battle-array till
noon, when the emissaries returning from the
country, announced that nothing but the foot-
steps of the enemy were to be seen. All hope,
or rather sear of an engagement being at an
end, they returned home, and the army was
dissolved without the loss of a drop of blood.
The enemy being gone, the dead body of
the Spaniard which had been wounded in such
a manner, that the bowels fell out, was brought
from the estate, and conveyed to the grave with
the Christian forms of burial.
