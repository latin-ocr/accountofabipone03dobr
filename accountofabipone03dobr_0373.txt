plundering of his horses, was drawing near to
the colony3 at another, the vengeful Tobas were
said to 'be coming with confederate savages.
As no hope of tranquillity, or shadow of security
appeared, there was not one of the Spaniards
who did not ardently desire a speedy departure
from the colony, and all the soldiers who were
ordered thither by their captains thought them-
selves condemned to the quarrieS, or to the oar.
The 'richer and more respectable strove to
evade the journey on pretence of business, in-
disposition‚ or by some other feigned excuses3
hence none but the meaner soldiers‚ Spaniards
only in name, attended our town, and were ra-
ther a burden than a protection to us, Such
were generally those who, in the beginning,
were dispatched every month to our colony,
both to bring us certain necessaries, and to see
whetherI was still alive. They were often pre-
vented from reaching us from fear of the savages;
at other times every thing they brought was so
spoilt with the water as to be of no possible use:
these were frequent causes of distress in the co-
lony.
