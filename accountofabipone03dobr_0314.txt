302 Hrsronv OF THE ABIPONES.

Moreover the Corrientines, reduced almost⁴ to
desperation by long war, were enabled to build
ships, and waggons on the opposite shore of
the river on which our colony stood, and which
abounds in most excellent trees, and to enrich
themselves by commerce without danger. In
the year 1767, when we returned to Europe,
the number of Christian Yaaukanigas was two
hundred, the rest having· died of small-pox and
other diseases. The survivors, exasperated at
the Spaniards on account of our banishment,
burnt the church and the houses of the Fathers to
asheS‚ deserted the colony they had inhabited
for seventeen yearS‚ and returned to their
ancient retreats and their old habits of plunder-
ing. A priest os the order of St. Francis, who
had been substituted in our stead, scarce pre-
served his life by flying to the city. Soun-
fortunate was the event of a colony that had-

cost us so much labour and misery, an event
highly pernicious to the Corrientines and other

Spaniards, against whom the Indians resumed
their armS, soon after quitting the colony.
