HrsTORY oF THE ABIPONES. 387

I had left two thousand and seventeen Chris-
tians on my departure, and that the neighbour-
ing town of St. Stanislaus‚ which had formerly
contained two thousand three hundred neo-
phytes, was entirely destitute of inhabitants.
Some secular priests, as well as monks, were
indeed put in place of the Jesuits‚ but they
were all such as disliked the IndianS, or were
disliked by thern, having undertaken the care
of the towns, not spontaneously as we did,
but by compulsion. Some came weeping, as
I myself witnessed3 otherS‚ weary of dwelling
ever so short awhile amongst the indigent and
formidable Indians, fell sick, or feigned to do so,
that they might be permitted to return. How
much could I write on this subject! but it is
better to be silent. Time will discover things,
which, though perfectly true, cannot with pro-
priety be inserted in books.
