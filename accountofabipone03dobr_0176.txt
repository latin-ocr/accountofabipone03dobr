164 HISTORY oF THE ABIPONES.

Charruas‚ savages whom they had reduced to
subjection.

Whilst Ychoalay was vainly seeking assistance
in every quarter, Debayakaikin conducted his
forces with all possible secrecy towards the
south, but did not precipitate his assault on the
colony, choosing rather to make use of craft.
He sent forward some of his people with a
commission to spread a report, that Debayakai-
kin did not intend attempting any thing against
the colony of St. Jeronymo, but that the savage
Mocobios purposed an immediate assault on the
town of Concepcion, which was ten leagues
distant from that of Jeronymo, and inhabited
by the Abipones under the authority of Alaykin}
Debayakaikin had two reasons for spreading
these fictitious reports. The first was, that, as
soon as the inhabitants of St. J eronymo underss-
stood themselves to be out of danger of an
attack‚ the Christian Mocobios, who acted as ’
guards, would be sent back to their town of St.
Xavier. The other was, that the Abipones of
the town of Concepcion, whilst in hourly expec-
tation of a hostile attack at home, would not be
able even to think of succouring the inhabitants
of St. J eronymo against Debayakaikin. ·In both
points the stratagem succeeded entirely to his
wish. Itis worth while to give a relation of the
whole event, of which Ι myself was aspectator.
