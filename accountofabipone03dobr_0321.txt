CHAPTER XXXVI.

COMMENCEMENT OF THE COLONY.

ΤΗΕ Governor distinguished the colony he
was founding with the name of S. Carlos and
the Rosary, that he might at the same time
show his piety to the Virgin Mary, and ingra-
tiate himself with Carlos the Third, King of
Spain. He and I embarked on the 24th of
November, 1763, and were saluted with guns
on the banks of the Paraguay. Our company
consisted of four hundred provincial soldiers;
Fulgentio de Yegros conducted the cavalry by
land, and the rest of the infantry were dis-
tributed into three ships and came with us.
We went on shore every night, and at mid-day
also, whenever we found a convenient landing-
place. The Paraguay abounds in shoals and
hidden rockS‚ yet the danger arising from them
was not so great as the inconvenience occa-
sioned by innumerable gnats, during our ten
days’ voyage. Fulgentio de Yegros, with his
company of horse, awaited us at a place called
Passo del Timbo. On our landing‚ crowds of

Abipones swam from the opposite shore, which
they inhabited, to salute us Some hundred
